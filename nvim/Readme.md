# Neovim Configuration

This Neovim configuration is designed to optimize development with a custom color scheme for readability, code formatting using `conform.lua`, and database management through `vim-dadbod`. It features a custom startup dashboard for quick workflow initiation, Git diff views with `difviewGIT.lua`, fuzzy file search via `fzf.lua`, and image preview support. Indentation helpers, LSP integration for autocompletion and error checking, and a customized status line with `lualine.lua` enhance productivity. Markdown preview, automatic pairing with `mini-autopairs.lua`, and code pattern highlighting through `mini-hipatterns.lua` streamline editing. Snippets and shortcuts are managed with `snacks.lua`, while file management is made easy with `nvim-tree.lua`. Telescope integration enables fuzzy finding, and `nvim-cmp` offers intelligent autocompletion. Key mappings and shortcuts ensure smooth navigation, WakaTime integration tracks coding activity, and `which-key.lua` improves discoverability of keybindings. This setup boosts productivity and workflow efficiency across various tasks.
